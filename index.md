## About

My name is Yunze Zeng (曾云泽). I am a Research Scientist at [Bosch Research](https://www.bosch.com/research/) in Sunnyvale, CA. I am currently focusing on building Wireless Sensing and Networking Systems with Machine Learning. Especially, I am bringing Wireless Sensing ideas to enable new business for Bosch in automotive and smart home/building applications.

I received my Ph.D. in [Computer Science](https://cs.ucdavis.edu/) from [University of California Davis](https://www.ucdavis.edu/) where I was supervised by Prof. [Prasant Mohapatra](https://faculty.engineering.ucdavis.edu/mohapatra/). During the study at Davis, I was selected as [Business Development Fellow](https://gsm.ucdavis.edu/profile/yunze-zeng) from [Graduate School of Management](https://gsm.ucdavis.edu/), and I got [Honorable Mention](https://cs.ucdavis.edu/news) in Recognition of Outstanding Graduate Research from [Computer Science Department](https://cs.ucdavis.edu/).

Before coming to Davis, I received my B.S. from [Beijing Jiaotong University](http://en.njtu.edu.cn/) in China where I was studying in Science Experimental Class (["思源班"](https://baike.baidu.com/item/%E6%80%9D%E6%BA%90%E7%8F%AD)). As an undergraduate, I was also a visiting student at [University of California San Diego](https://ucsd.edu/).
